Chain of Thought for Encryption System Implementation
======================================================

1. Analyzed the requirement to create self-decrypting virus with encryption using syscall-generated keys.

2. Decided to use getrandom(2) syscall for cryptographically secure random number generation rather than alternatives like /dev/urandom to avoid file I/O.

3. Chose XOR cipher combined with ROL (rotate left) 3-bit rotation for simplicity and reversibility - XOR is self-inverse and rotation is easily reversed with ROR.

4. Selected 16-byte key size as a balance between security (larger keyspace) and simplicity (fits in registers, easy modulo operations).

5. Mapped random bytes to alphanumeric charset (0-9A-Za-z, 62 chars) by taking modulo 62 to ensure printable, shell-safe key representation.

6. Positioned encryption_key at virus_start+8 (after original_entry_storage) to keep all virus metadata together at the beginning.

7. Added encrypted_flag at virus_start+24 (after 8-byte entry + 16-byte key) as a 1-byte indicator to avoid redundant decryption.

8. Placed decrypt_code function early in virus code, before .run_as_virus, to ensure decryptor itself is never encrypted - chicken-and-egg problem otherwise.

9. Used decrypt_code.end marker to define exact boundary where encryption begins, allowing surgical encryption of only the necessary code.

10. Modified Makefile to build both Famine and encrypt binaries without auto-running encryption, giving user manual control over when to encrypt.

11. Updated encrypt program to accept filename as command-line argument (via stack parsing: pop argc, argv[0], argv[1]) for flexibility.

12. Implemented decrypt algorithm as exact inverse: ROR 3 bits (reverses ROL 3), then XOR with same key (XOR is self-inverse).

13. Used buffer index (rbx) directly for key indexing via modulo division, matching encrypt's separate counter that increments with buffer offset.

14. Saved all callee-saved registers (rbx, r8, r9, r12-r15) in decrypt_code to prevent corruption of calling context.

15. Used `mov rsp, rbp` before `pop rbp` in function epilogue to ensure stack is properly balanced - critical for preventing segfaults.

16. Verified encryption correctness by comparing assembly output with Python reference implementation byte-for-byte - they match perfectly.

17. Confirmed decryption algorithm by manually decrypting with Python and testing the result - proves cipher is mathematically sound and passes all 26 tests.

18. Fixed critical bug: removed r10 from saved registers and added r8, r9 to match actual register usage in decrypt loop.

19. Ensured proper register initialization (xor r8, r8; xor r9, r9) to avoid garbage values affecting decryption operations.

20. Per user feedback, added dynamic storage for encrypted_offset and encrypted_size (both 8 bytes) in virus_start structure to support position-independent encryption.

21. Modified encrypt program to store encrypted region offset (relative to virus_start) and size, enabling dynamic decryption at runtime without hardcoded addresses.

22. Updated decrypt runtime to read encrypted_offset and encrypted_size from stored values and calculate buffer address relative to virus_start for position-independence.

23. Debugged assembly decrypt_code extensively - encryption works, Python manual decryption works, all tests pass unencrypted, but assembly decrypt still has persistent segfault requiring further low-level investigation.
